So first of all I need to setup the GDT, which includes segmentation. From what
I understand I need to make a GDT which includes some stuff like where the
different segments reside. So I think what should be done is we should have the
kernel segments (data, code) defined in the GDT, the various TSS's and then the
LDT's. The GDT will be stored as a global variable.
